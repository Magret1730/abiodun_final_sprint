# E-Commerce Web Application (React)

A fully functional **E-Commerce Web Application** built with **React** that allows users to browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and proceed through a checkout process.   This project uses a **mock server (JSON Server)** to simulate backend API interactions for seamless development and testing.

|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/products`      | Fetch all products                   |
| GET    | `/products/:id`  | Fetch details for a specific product |
| PUT    | `/products/:id`  | Update details for a specific product|
| DELETE | `/products/:id`  | Delete a specific product            |
| POST   | `/cart`          | Add a product to the cart            |
| GET    | `/cart`          | Retrieve cart items                  |
